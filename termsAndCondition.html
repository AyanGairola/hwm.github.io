Because of such price fluctuations, you may gain or lose value of your assets at any given moment. Digital Assets may be subject to large swings in value and may even become completely worthless. There is always an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling, or trading anything on the market. Digital Asset trading has specific risks, which are not shared with other official currencies, goods, or commodities in a market.

2.2. Taxes may be payable on any return and/or on any increase in the value of your Digital Assets and you should seek independent advice on your tax obligations. CEX.IO is not responsible for any violation made by the User due to his/her obligation to calculate and pay taxes and duties.
